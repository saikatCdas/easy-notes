## How to use:

* Clone this repository on your local `plugin folder`

* Run command `npm i` to install node modules.

Now just setup for your own plugin, it's very easy using node auto command.
##### 1. Auto setup:
Just run `node src/setup`
it will ask for a plugin name, type your plugin name and hit enter.

Your plugin is ready to use.

Now run `npm run watch`
Then activate the plugin from your WP admin dashboard.

If you want to make setup by hand you can do it also. But auto setup is the best option for you.
